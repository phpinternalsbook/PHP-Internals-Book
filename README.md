PHP-Internals-Book
==================

Document format: RST
--------------------

The book is written using ReStructured Text and generated using Sphinx.

 * RST manual: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html
 * RST quickref: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html
 * Sphinx manual: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

Coding style
------------

The following "coding style" applies to the written text, not to the included code.

 * The maximum line-width for text is 120 characters.
 * The maximum line-width for code is 98 characters. Including the four space indentation this would be a limit of 102 characters. This is a hard limit that prevents overflows in the PDF version.
 * Indentation uses four spaces.
 * Lines should not have trailing whitespace.
 * Punctuation like `?`, `!` or `:` should directly follow after the word (e.g. `foo:` rather than `foo :`).
