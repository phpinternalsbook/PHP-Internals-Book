Classes and objects
===================

In recent years PHP has been turning more and more from a procedural language to an object-oriented one. Even though
the fundamentals are still of procedural nature (in particular large parts of the standard library) most library code
nowadays is developed in terms of classes and objects. This chapter covers the rather complex internals of PHP's object
orientation system.
