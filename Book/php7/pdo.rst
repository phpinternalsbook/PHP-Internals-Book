PDO Driver How-To
=================

The purpose of this How-To is to provide a basic understanding of the steps
required to write a database driver that interfaces with the PDO layer.
Please note that this is still an evolving API and as such, subject to
change. This document was prepared based on version 0.3 of PDO.
The learning curve is steep; expect to spend a lot of time on the
prerequisites.
